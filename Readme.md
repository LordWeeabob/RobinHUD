#RobinHUD

RobinHUD is a project that started in early 2015 when I grew tired of trying to pick a hud I was completely happy with from the directory on Huds.tf. Its aim is to provide a change from the current selection of custom HUDs being dominated by minimalism. 

**Current Version:** 1.0

##FAQ:##

**Q:** How do I install this hud?

**A:** Download the zip and extract the RobinHUD folder into your "tf/custom" folder. **By default the HUD is configured for 16x9 resolutions. If you use a 16x10 resolution, copy the files inside the 16x10 folder into your RobinHUD folder.**

**Q:** Your HUD is broken how do I contact you?

**A:** Make a discussion on the [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RobinHUD)

**Q:** Does this HUD work on OSX/Linux?

**A:** Currently it does not work on OSX and I haven't tested Linux yet, but they are on the **TODO** list!


##TO-DO List:##
* Add support for 4x3 resolutions
* Toggleable Scoreboards for 6v6 and 9v9
* Add Mann vs Machine Support
* Add Matchmaking HUD(Currently I think the MM hud looks good on its own so this is a **MAYBE**)
